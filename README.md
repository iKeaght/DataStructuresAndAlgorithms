# About the repository
It is a personal project I created while learning about data structures and algorithms.<br>
After learning theory, I wanted to learn by praticing !

# How to use 
You can clone the repository and use a large number of algorithms on various data structures.<br>
Write you code directly inside main.cpp.

## Search algorithms
You can use the following algorithms : 
 - Linear Search
 - Binary Search
 - Longest Common Subsequence
 - Depth First Search
 - Breadth First Search


## Sorting algorithm
You can use the following algorithms : 
 - Bubble Sort
 - Bucket Sort
 - Counting Sort
 - Heap Sort 
 - Insertion Sort 
 - Merge Sort
 - Quick Sort
 - Radix Sort 
 - Selection Sort
 - Shell Sort

 ## Data Structures
You can create "Tree" and "Graph" classes using their respective classes.
